"""Client for interacting with MindsDB models.

This module wraps the connection logic to a MindsDB server and exposes
convenience functions to run predictions against a trained recommender
model. While the actual model training happens inside MindsDB (typically
configured via their dashboard or SQL interface), this client demonstrates
how to send inputs and receive outputs programmatically.
